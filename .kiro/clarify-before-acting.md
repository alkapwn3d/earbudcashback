# Clarify Before Acting

## When to Ask
- Vague terms ("fast", "better", "like X", "optimize")
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- About to make assumptions

## How
- Present options with tradeoffs
- Ask what priority matters (performance/simplicity/compatibility)
- Stop immediately if going wrong direction

## Balance
- "Install nginx" → Just do it
- "Set up web server" → Ask which
- "Make it fast" → Ask what aspect
