# Explain Before Doing

## Rule
Before running commands, briefly explain what it does, why it's needed, and expected outcome.

## Format
"[Action]: [What] - [Why] - [Expected result]"

Then execute.

## Example
Bad: Just run command
Good: "Installing base packages with pacstrap - creates minimal system in container directory - gives us bootable Arch environment"
