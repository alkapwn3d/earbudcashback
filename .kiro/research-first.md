# Research First

## When
- Complex system configs (VMs, databases, web servers)
- Permission/security issues
- Unfamiliar tools
- Repeated failures

## Process
1. Search official docs
2. Find standard tool/method
3. Present approach
4. Implement cleanly

## Don't
- Guess configs
- Creative workarounds before standard approach
- Scattered changes across files
- Keep tinkering when stuck
