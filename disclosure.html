                <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
                <p><em>Last Updated: January 30, 2026</em></p>

                <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                <p>EarbudCashback participates in affiliate marketing programs, including but not limited to the Awin affiliate network. This means we earn commissions when you make purchases through the links on our website.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>When you click on a product link or "Shop Now" button on our site and make a purchase from a retailer, we receive a commission from that retailer at no additional cost to you. We share a portion of this commission with you as cashback.</p>

                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our recommendations or the cashback rates we offer. We strive to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature deals from reputable retailers only</li>
                    <li>Provide accurate cashback percentages</li>
                    <li>Process cashback payments fairly and promptly</li>
                    <li>Maintain transparency about how we earn revenue</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Your Cost</h2>
                <p>Using our affiliate links and earning cashback does not increase the price you pay. In fact, you save money through our cashback program. The commission we earn comes from the retailer's marketing budget.</p>

                <h2>Tracking and Cookies</h2>
                <p>When you click our affiliate links, cookies are placed on your device to track your purchase. This is necessary to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure we receive credit for referring you</li>
                    <li>Verify your purchase for cashback processing</li>
                    <li>Attribute the correct cashback amount to your transaction</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <p>If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or how cashback works, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
